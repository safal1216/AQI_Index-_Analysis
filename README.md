# AQI_Index-_Analysis
Analysis aims to provide a numerical value representative of overall air quality, essential for public health and environmental management
Below are the steps we can follow for the task of Air Quality Index Analysis:

-> Gather air quality data from various sources, such as government monitoring stations, sensors, or satellite imagery.
-> Clean and preprocess the collected data.
-> Calculate the Air Quality Index using standardized formulas and guidelines provided by environmental agencies.
-> Create visualizations, such as line charts or heatmaps, to represent the AQI over time or across geographical regions.
-> Compare the AQI metrics of the location with the recommended air quality metrics.
